What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Metadata starts getting associated with the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I can make a logical commit including several files, even if my working directory has several changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By lumping all relevant files into the staging area ahead of the commit
