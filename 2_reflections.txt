What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Metadata starts getting associated with the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I can make a logical commit including several files, even if my working directory has several changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By lumping all relevant files into the staging area ahead of the commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Isolating a larger logical unit spanning multiple commits to a separate branch, eventually merging it back in as a single commit.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Because our brains are wired to understand conceptual diagrams better.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Includes code changes made to both branches. Easy to understand?
