When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm collaborating with multiple developers. And if I'm afraid my local disk/computer could breakdown or be lost.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To avoid constnt conflicts in my local code. Deal with that churn when I'm prepared for it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forking makes sense when it's likely there is a divergence between the two repos that might be irreconcilable
Cloning is when the repos need to be in tight lockstep
Branches are useful for context switching within a repo.
