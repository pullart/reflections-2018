When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm collaborating with multiple developers. And if I'm afraid my local disk/computer could breakdown or be lost.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To avoid constnt conflicts in my local code. Deal with that churn when I'm prepared for it.
