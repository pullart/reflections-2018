Github learning
 A Git commit is a logical aggregation of meaningful changes. This is why looking through history becomes useful.
One commit per logical change. One purpose that is easily understood.

Git diff - compares 2 versions of a file within git (“operates on” commits)
Diff - regular comparison between 2 files

Git calls a collection of files a repository. But it isn't just the files. It includes the history for these files too.
It tracks the status of all files when doign a commit to the repository.
git log --stat : Commit history alongside which files have changed in each commit

git clone - the command to copy a repository from one computer to another
git checkout - the command to change your repository to the snapshot corresponding to a specific commit 
git init - turn a regular directory into a git repository. Does not make any commits. Does not track the status of any files within.
git status - a good status summary of the repository

git add - add files to a staging area ahead of a single commit incorporating potentially multiple files


Reflections:

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
By focusing only on what changed as opposed to the entire file, we can narrow down the root cause of the issue.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
We can identify what was added to the file, alongside why and when. This context is very helpful when deciding when an issue may have been introduced into the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Because having a clear and single purpose for each commit makes it easier to study in the future.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because Git was designed for code, where logical changes can span multiple files. Google docs treats documents as isolated entities.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log gives me the descriptions of the commits that went in. Git diff helps me zoom into a specific commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because I can go back in time to undo these mistakes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
We're moving to Git at work. This is survival.
